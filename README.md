# flASh!..bOOm!
> Python script to estimate the distance of lightning.

Estimate the distance of lightning by measuring the time between the 'flash'
and the 'boom' during a thunderstorm *(or any other event you can see before
you can hear because of the distance).*
For increased accuracy, the air temperature can also be set in order to
fine-tune the *speed of sound* to the conditions.

## Installation

**macOS & Linux:**
Just save the *FlashBoom* folder to a location of your choosing.

**Windows:**
This script hasn't been tested on Windows, but should work (?) the same as
with Mac & Linux systems.

## Requirements

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org "Python's homepage")

To check which version of Python3 you have (if any), open a terminal and type:

```
python3 -V
```

*(flASh!..bOOm! was developed using Python 3.7.5 on macOS Catalina.)*

## Usage

Open a terminal and *cd* to the *FlashBoom* directory, then execute the
``flashboom.py`` file with Python:

```
python3 flashboom.py
```

Whenever the *flASh!* button is pressed (with LMB or SPACE) the timer will
reset and start. After the flash, pressing the *bOOm!* button will stop the
timer and display the distance estimation in metres.
The *Reset* button clears the display and the history box. It will also stop
the timer if it was running.

To increase the accuracy, the air temperature can be set as well (Â°Celcius).
Do this by hovering the mouse-pointer over the spinbox and turning the
mouse-wheel. (On Linux the entire spinbox may be greyed out, it still works
though.)

## Release History
